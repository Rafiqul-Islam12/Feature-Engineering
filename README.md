# ***Feature Transformation / Data Scaling***
***Scaling means changing the range or distribution of features so that:***   
- ***No feature dominates others.***
- ***The model converges faster.***
- ***The algorithm’s performance improves.***

### ***Normalization & Standardization Concept***
- ***Normalization is a process that transforms your data's features to a standard scale, typically `between 0 and 1`. This is achieved by adjusting each feature's values based on its minimum and maximum values. The goal is to ensure that no single feature dominates the others due to its magnitude.***  
- ***Standardization is a process that transforms your data’s features so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is achieved by adjusting each feature’s values based on the mean and standard deviation of that feature.***

***Where:***  
- ***X is the original value,***  
- ***mu is the mean of the feature, and***  
- ***sigma is the standard deviation of the feature.***  

***This formula rescales the data in such a way that its distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.***
